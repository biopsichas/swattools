\title{Function plot heatmaps to compare results from scenarios}
\usage{
plot_scenarios_heatmap(df, filter_scenario_by_vector = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data.frame of data extracted from output.rch and output.sub files and processed with get_diff_from_baseline function.
Beside other columns has to have SCENARIO column, which join all information about scenario.}

\item{filter_scenario_by_vector}{Vector, which allows to filter scenarios. Filtering could be done by AND providing
vector members seperated by comma, or by OR seperating one vector member in many '|'. For example
c("rcp45", "2080_2099", "Minija|Merkys|Dauguva") this vector filter by AND and by OR.}
}
\value{
heatmap plot
}
\description{
This function allows plotting heatmaps for the scenario results extracted and averaged
from output.rch and output.sub SWAT output files.
}
\examples{
##plot_scenarios_heatmap(df, c("measure_30", "rcp45", "2080_2099", "Daugyvene"))
